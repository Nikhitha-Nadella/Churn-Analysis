# Churn-Analysis

**Telco Customer Churn Analysis**
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using Python to identify key factors driving customer churn in the telecom sector.

📌 Objective
To analyze customer behavior and identify the major drivers of churn, with the goal of recommending actionable strategies to improve retention.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn dataset (public, 7043 records × 21 columns)

📊 Key Analyses
Overall churn rate: 26.5%

Churn by demographics: Senior citizens churned at 41.7%, significantly higher than other groups

Churn by contract type:

Monthly: 43.5%

One-year: 11%

Two-year: 2.9%

Churn by internet service: Fiber optic users showed the highest churn (41.5%)

Churn by value-added services: Lack of services like online security, tech support, and device protection was linked to higher churn

Tenure and charges:

Lower tenure = higher churn

High monthly charges = higher churn

🔍 Key Insights
Monthly contracts and fiber optic plans are associated with high churn

Senior citizens are 74% more likely to churn than younger users

Absence of optional services correlates with customer dissatisfaction

Early tenure is a high-risk phase—onboarding strategies are crucial

💡 Recommendations
Target senior citizens and fiber users with personalized retention plans

Bundle tech support and security services

Consider loyalty pricing tiers for long-term or high-usage customers

Enhance onboarding experience to reduce early churn

📈 Next Steps
Build a predictive machine learning model to identify high-risk customers proactively
